## rawSeqGenbank.zip

The genomes of three Salmonella species.  Genbank format contains annotation information and can be used directly in progressiveMauve alignment.  If fasta is needed, an appropriate converter is required or can be done manually through Geneious (free|paid-version) or other viewer.  These genomes contain fairly large inverted tracks as evident from the xmfa alignment below.   

## msa.xmfa.zip

The alignment of the three Salmonella species using progressiveMauve (build date Feb 25 2015) with default parameters (non-collinear mode).  

## NEED one or two short read data sets here
